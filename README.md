# Weatherstation dashboard

This is a weatherstation / dashboard, meant for tablet view, in a MySensors home automation setup.

It uses mqtt for obtaining data from sensors / home automation system, mainly formatted with topics compatible with MySensors mqtt topic format. It relies on a couple of other mqtt message topics, generated by my node-red flows, which can be found at [github](https://github.com/tbowmo/nodered-mysensors-flow).


Probably not usefull for most people, but kept here as an example of what can be done with mysensors / mqtt / angular
